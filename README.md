## UC2 - Compare Length in Feet and Inches

### Objective
To verify equality between length values measured in different units (Feet and Inches).

### Problem Statement
Given two length values where:
- One value is in Feet
- One value is in Inches

The system should correctly determine whether both represent the same physical length.

### Implementation
- Created an `Inches` class
- Stored length value as `double`
- Implemented logic to convert inches to feet (or vice versa) for comparison
- Used overridden `equals()` method for value-based comparison
- Written JUnit test cases for cross-unit validation

### Concepts Used
- OOP
- Encapsulation
- Unit Conversion
- Method Overriding
- Floating Point Comparison
- Unit Testing

### Outcome
Successfully implemented comparison between different measurement units by introducing unit conversion logic.

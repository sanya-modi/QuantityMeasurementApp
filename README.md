## UC1 - Compare Two Lengths in Feet

### Objective
To verify equality of two length values measured in feet.

### Problem Statement
Given two length values in feet, check whether they are equal.

### Implementation
- Created a `Feet` class
- Stored length value as `double`
- Overridden `equals()` method to compare values
- Written JUnit test cases

### Concepts Used
- OOP
- Encapsulation
- Method Overriding
- Unit Testing

### Outcome
Successfully compared two length objects based on value instead of reference.
